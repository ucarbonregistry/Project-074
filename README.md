Prior GHG History:
The project activity is a small-scale hydro project and has not achieved any registration or issuance under any other GHG mechanism prior to this registration with UCR. However, project was applied under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of UNFCCC for initial listing under the title “Darna Small Hydro Project of DLI Power (India) Private Limited”, for the Period of Comments “11 Feb 2010 to 12 Mar 2010”; but did not proceed further in the validation process. This information can be verified from the CDM web interface. Also, project has not been applied for any other environmental crediting or certification mechanism under any regional or national or international platforms other than UCR. Hence project will not cause double accounting of carbon credits (i.e., COUs).
